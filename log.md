    - commands do things.
    - branches decide things.
    - loops repeat things.
* Conditionals help you decide if 
    - something is True or False.
* Assignment sets a name to a value.
* A named value is stored in a "variable".

Python Tools
* if/else branches
* while loops
* = assignment operator
* == equality operator
* != inequality operator
* > greater than operator
* print() display a message on screen
* input() gets and returns user input
* int() converts characters to numbers
* randint() produces a random number
